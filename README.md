# Flask Drawing Application

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to draw digits on a canvas and get predictions on which digit they have drawn. The application also includes a history feature where users can save their drawings and mark predictions as correct or incorrect.

## Features

- **Draw Digits**: Users can draw digits on a canvas using their mouse.
- **Real-time Prediction**: The app predicts the drawn digit in real-time using a pre-trained ONNX model.
- **Prediction History**: Users can save their drawings to a history with the associated prediction, and mark the prediction as correct or incorrect.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can clear the canvas or save their drawing with dedicated buttons.
